Hello world!!!

I'm new-ish to OpenSource and microservices but I'm going to learn.

I once heard that you must learn python, ansible, and SDN, or get left behind.
I'd like to add powershell and unix administration to that list.

Self-imposed discipline is the surest way to increase the quality of your existence.
